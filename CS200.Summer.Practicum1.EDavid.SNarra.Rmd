DO NOT USE THIS! instead use the SQLite in memory to load the raw data - this r code uses in-line 
write in the MySQL database.

Task 6(10pts / 1hr):

Single query on number of incidents by month (across all years) in ascending order by month.
```{sql connection=mysqlconnection}
SELECT COUNT(*) As Number_of_incidents, DATE_FORMAT(flight_date, '%m') As MONTH FROM 
    incidents GROUP BY MONTH(flight_date) ORDER BY MONTH ASC;
```

Sum all the number of incidents per month to match the total incidents / records.
```{sql connection=mysqlconnection}
SELECT SUM(Number_of_incidents) As "Total Incidents" FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) As 
    Number_of_incidents, DATE_FORMAT(flight_date, '%m') As MONTH FROM incidents 
    GROUP BY MONTH(flight_date)) As sub;
```


Task 7(5pts / 4hrs):

Getting the Number of incidents per year.
```{sql connection=mysqlconnection}
SELECT COUNT(*) As Number_of_incidents, DATE_FORMAT(flight_date, '%Y') As YEAR FROM 
    incidents GROUP BY YEAR(flight_date);
```

Using sub-groups to filter the query only from 2005 to 2011.
```{sql connection=mysqlconnection}
SELECT Number_of_incidents, YEAR FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) As Number_of_incidents, 
    DATE_FORMAT(flight_date, '%Y') As YEAR FROM incidents GROUP BY YEAR(flight_date)) 
    As sub HAVING YEAR > 2004 ORDER BY YEAR ASC;
```

Plot the number of incidents per year from 2005 to 2011. 
```{r}
# generate a dataframe for task 7.
task7 <- dbGetQuery(conn = mysqlconnection, statement = "SELECT Number_of_incidents, 
                    YEAR FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) As Number_of_incidents, 
                    DATE_FORMAT(flight_date, '%Y') As YEAR FROM incidents GROUP BY 
                    YEAR(flight_date)) As sub HAVING YEAR > 2004 ORDER BY YEAR ASC;")

# define the column needed to plot.
input <- task7[, c('YEAR', 'Number_of_incidents')]

# change the year to integer data type
input$YEAR <- as.integer(input$YEAR)

# plot the input dataframe
barplot(input$Number_of_incidents, names.arg = input$YEAR, xlab = "Year", 
        ylab = "Number of Incidents", col = "blue", main = "Incidents per Year")
